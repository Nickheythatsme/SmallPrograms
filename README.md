# Cpp_small_programs
This is a collection of small programs I have made. Some are for class room assignments, some are to help me with concepts in class (see Math folder), and some are just fun experiemnts

### School Work 
This is a collection of my assignments for class.
CS162, CS163, CS202 are a three part series in C++, with some Java at the end of CS202. I am particularly proud of some of the CS202 programs, especially programs 2(C++) and 5 (Java).


### misc
These programs are just for fun. There's a word_count.py file in there because I had to write some reports for classes in plain text.

### C
These are C programs (I didn't see the point in another repository). Some are from my class CS201, and some are just for fun and for getting to know C.

### Math
These are programs mostly for my linear algebra course. I like programing for linear algebra, especially with performance in mind since even simple operations can quickly become computationally cumbersome.
