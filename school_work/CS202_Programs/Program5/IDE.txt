Program 5

    On program 4 and program 5 I used an IDE for java, rather than using vim and 
console line compiling/running. This was a big change for me, as I had never
really used an IDE. I found it was much quicker to use the IDE however, and I 
was amazed at some of the tips/errors the IDE can inform me about. I think this
helped me learn more quickly about java syntax/compiling.
    I really appreciate the VIM plugin. I find I work so much more quickly when
I can use VIM commands. I did however find the workspace configuration lacking.
With VIM I can configure the windows any way I want (vsplits, tabs, horozontil
splits), then save this configuration for different parts of my project. If I
need to work on cars/car nodes, it is useful to have a workspace specifically
for that.
    One thing I also really appreciated was the debugging aspect of the IDE. I
was able to pinpoint easily where my program seg faulted, or where stack 
overflows might be happening. Java is also an very easy language to use in
this regard.
