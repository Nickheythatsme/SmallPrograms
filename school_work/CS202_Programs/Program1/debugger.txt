Program 1 Review


    I used the debugger a lot in this program. I used to use it only when I got
seg faults, however in this program I used it to make sure the right 
constructors were beign called. This was my first OOP program, and the first one
with heiarchical structure, so being able to see my code run in gdb helped a 
ton. I learned a lot about how certain classes are constructed, and how to 
create them. For example, I was having a lot of trouble with the DLL, all of my
classes would be converted into the furthest base class, celestial_body. This
meant I was losing information that inner/outer planets needed. I looked up the 
source file in GDB and set break points, then looked at the back trace to see
which constructors were being called and why. I realized I had a function in my
node class which went:
    bool insert(node * obj)
    {
        node * new_node = new node(obj);
        ...
    }
    This meant that whatever class pointer was sent to this program, whether
it was an inner planet or outer planet, would be converted into a node class
and would lose information. I figured out that I should make another insert
function in my derived class, then make the desired new object in that derived
class and send it to the node insert.
